* make sure UTF-8 support is correctly handled

	Is Cassandra all UTF-8 or are some types not?  Is there anything we need
	to do for it to work?

* create a demonstration that uses SSL for the connection to the cassandra cluster (the Tcl/C interface has interfaces to their slightly lame SSL setup calls.  Use them to create the demo.)

	The interfaces are there but they take the arguments as strings.  It'll need some scaffolding to get files from the right plances into the right calls.  A demo will show connecting over SSL to a cluster and document that.

* allow where the cassandra cpp-driver library is located to be specified rather than assuming it is in /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib

* maybe detect if tcl isn't built with threads and stop because cassandra doesn't work with threads

* support the following data types in casstcl_cass_value_to_tcl_obj:
	* custom
	* decimal
	* inet
	* varint
	* timeuuid
