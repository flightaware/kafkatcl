Overview
---

You've got your kafka object, which is like your master connection.

Using methods of your kafka object you create kafka handle objects.

Kafka handle objects are used to create topic producers and consumers.

Topic producer and consumer objects are used to produce and consume messages to kafka.


KafkaTcl command
---

The kafkatcl command from which all others are created is **::kafka::kafka**.

* **kafka::kafka** **version**

Returns the kafka version as a string, like 0.8.6.

* **kafka::kafka** **create** *command*

Create a kafka object.  If *command* is **#auto** then an handle with a unique name such as **kafka_handle0** will be created for you.  Of course with that usage you'd want to capture the handle name in a variable or something.

```tcl
set kafka [::kafka::kafka create #auto]

$kafka logger callback klog

set consumer [$kafka create_consumer #auto]
```

...or...

```tcl
::kafka::kafka create kafka]

kafka logger callback klog

kafka create_consumer consumer
```

Methods of kafka interface object
---

* *$kafka* **config** *?key value?*

If invoked without arguments, returns a list of the configuration properties and values suitable for passing to *array set* or whatever.  If invoked with a key and value, sets the key-value pair into the configuration properties.

Returns a Tcl error if it fails.

* *$kafka* **create_producer** *cmdName*

Create a kafkatcl producer handle object.  the producer handle object is used to establish communications with the kafka cluster and eventually create topic producer objects.

* *$kafka* **create_consumer** *cmdName*

Create a kafkatcl consumer handle object.  The consumer handle object is used to connect with the kafka cluster and eventually create topic consumer topics.

* *$kafka* **topic_config** *?key value?*

If invoked without arguments returns a list of the topic configuration properties and values.

If key and value are present sets a single kafka topic configuration property  by specifying the property name and value.  Returns a Tcl error if it fails.

* *$kafka* **set_delivery_report_callback** *command*

Invoke *command* when kafka cpp-driver delivery report callbacks are received.

* *$kafka* **set_error_callback** *command*

Invoke *command* when kafka cpp-driver error callbacks are received.

* *$kafka* **set_statistics_callback** *command*

Invoke *command* when kafka cpp-driver statistics callbacks are received.

The command will be invoked with one argument, which is the JSON provided by the stats callback.

* *$kafka* **set_socket_callback** 

Not yet implemented and may not be implemented.

* *$handle* **logger** **syslog**

Log kafka logger messages to the system log.

* *$handle* **logger** **stderr**

Log kafka logger messages to stderr.

* *$handle* **logger** **callback** *command*

Invoke the callback routine *command* when kafka logger messages are received.

After specifying this, when logging messages are received, *command* will be invoked with one argument containing a list of key-value pairs containing "level", the log level as an integer (this may change), "facility", the facility as a string, and "message" followed by the log message.

Logging callbacks may only be directed to one of the syslog, stderr or the callback command.  Changing to a new one ends the use of the previous one.


Methods of kafka handle object
---

* *$handle* **name**

Return the kafka name of the handle.

* *$handle* **new_topic** *commandName* *topic*

Creates a new topic consumer or producer object corresponding to the specified topic.

If the handle was created with the **create_producer** method then a topic producer object will be created.  If it was created with the **create_consumer** method then a topic consumer object will be created.

* *$handle* **log_level** *level*

Set the log level to one of **emerg**, **alert**, **crit**, **err**, **warning**, **notice**, **info**, or **debug**.

* *$handle* **add_brokers** *brokerList*

Add a list of kafka brokers to the kafka handle object.

* *$handle* **create_queue** *command*

Create a queue object named *command*.  If *command* is **#auto** then creates a unique command name such as *kafka_queue0*.

* *$handle* **output_queue_length**

Return the current output queue length, i.e. the messages waiting to be sent to, or acknowledged by, the broker.

* *$handle* **info** **topics**

Return a list of the topics defined on the kafka cluster.

* *$handle* **info** **brokers**

Return a list of all the brokers defined on the connected kafka cluster.  Each element is the IP address of the broker followed by a colon character followed by the port number of the broker, for example *10.3.7.3:9092*.

* *$handle* **info** **partitions** *topic*

Return the number of partitions defined for the specified topic.

* *$handle* delete

Delete the handle object, destroying the command.

Methods of kafka topic producer object
---

* *$topic* **produce** *partition* *payload* *?key?*

Produce one message into the specified partition.  If there's an error, you get a Tcl error.  IF the partition is -1 then the unassigned partition is specified, indicating that kafka should partition using the configured or default partitioner.

If *key* is specified then it's passed to the topic partitioner as well as sent to the broker and passed to the consumer.  That means the partitioning algorithm can use that to help pick the partition.  Also it's a value that can be sent through alongside the payload.

Methods of kafka topic consumer object
---

* *$topic* **consume** *partition* *timeout* *array*

Consume one message from the specified partition without *timeout* milliseconds into array *array*.  If there's an error, you get a Tcl error.

* *$topic* **consume_batch** *partition* *timeout* *count* *array* *code*

Read up to *count* messages or however many have come in less than that without *timeout* milliseconds.

For each message received fill the array *array* with fields from the message containing the message *payload*, *partition*, *offset*, *topic* name and optional *key*, repeatedly executing *code* for each message received.

*offset* can be **beginning** to start consuming at the beginning of the partition (i.e. the oldest message in the partition), **end** to start consuming from the end of the partition, **stored** to start consuming from the offset retrieved from the offset store, whatever that means, a positive integer, which starts consuming starting from the specified message number from that partition, or a negative integer, which says to start consuming that many messages from the end.

* *$topic* **consume_start** *partition* *offset*

Start consuming the established topic for the specified *partition* starting at offset *offset*.

* *$topic* **consume_start_queue** *partition* *offset* *queue*

Start consuming the established topic for the specified *partition*, starting at offset *offset*, re-routing incoming messages to the specified kafkatcl *queue* command object.

The queue should have been created with the *$handle* **create_queue** *command* method described elsewhere in this doc.

* *$topic* **consume_stop** *partition*

Stop consuming messages for the established topic and specified *partition*, purging all messages currently in the local queue.

* *$topic* **consume_callback** *partition* *timeoutMS* *command*

Repeated invoke *command* with one argument containing a list of key-value pairs for a received message, or a list of key-value pairs reporting an error.

If a message was successfully received the fields will be *payload*, *partition*, *offset*, *topic* and, optionally, *key*.

If an error is received the fields will be *error*, *code*, and *message* corresponding to the kafka error string returned by rd_kafka_err2str, the kafka error code and an error message.

**consume_callback** returns the number of messages consumed.

Note that you have to call *consume_callback* repeatedly and it may return 0 if no data is available at the time it is called.  Subsequent calls will return nonzero when messages are available.

```
consumer consume_callback 0 5000 callback
```

Consume messages from partition 0 by invoking the routine **callback** and timeout after a maximum of 5000 ms.

* *$topic* **delete**

Delete the topic object.

Methods of kafka topic consumer queue object
---
Queue objects are created using *$handle* **create_queue** *command* and messages from consumer topics can be fed to a queue using the **consume_start_queue** method of a topic consumer object.

Queue objects support the following methods:

* *$queue* **consume** *timeoutMS* *array*

As with consuming from a topic consumer, the **consume** method of a queue consuimes one message from the corresponding queue, within *timeout* milliseconds, into array *array*.  If there's an error, you get a Tcl error.

Unlike with the **consume** method of a topic consumer, the partition is not specified at this point, as it has been specified when **consume_start_queue** was used to hook a consumer into a local queue.

* *$queue* **consume_batch** *timeoutMS* *count* *array* *code*

As with consuming a batch from a topic, reads up to *count* messages or however many have come in less than that without *timeout* milliseconds.

For each message received the array *array* is filled with fields from the message containing the message *payload*, *partition*, *offset*, *topic* name and optional *key*, repeatedly executing *code* for each message received.

* *$queue* **consume_callback** *timeout* *command*

As with using a callback to consume from a topic, repeatedly invokes *command* with one argument containing a list of key-value pairs for a received message, or a list of key-value pairs reporting an error.

If the message was successfully received then the pairs will be *payload*, *partition*, *offset*, *topic* and, optionally, *key*.

If an error is received the fields will be *error*, *code*, and *message* corresponding to the kafka error string returned by rd_kafka_err2str, the kafka error code and an error message.

**consume_callback** returns the number of messages consumed.

Note that you have to invoke the *consume_callback* method repeatedly, and it will return 0 if no data is available at the time it is called.  Later, though, calling it again may well produce messages.

Received Kafka Messages
---

You specify the name of the array and if there isn't an error the array is populated with the following info from the message:

* payload

The message payload.

* partition

The partition number.

* key

The key will be provided if the (optional) key was specified when the message was produced.

* offset

The offset.

* topic

The name of the topic.

Setting up a consumer
---

Create a kafka object, from that use the *create_consumer* method to create a kafka consumer-creating object.  From that create a topic consuming object to read messages.

```tcl
package require kafka

::kafka::kafka create kafka_master

kafka_master create_consumer kafka_consumer
kafka_consumer add_brokers 127.0.0.1

kafka_consumer new_topic consumer test

consumer consume_start 0 0

consumer consume 0 2000 foo
parray foo
```

Setting up a producer
---

Create a kafka object, from that use the *create_producer* method to create a kafka producer-creating object.  From that create a topic producing object to produce messages to.  key is optional.

```tcl
package require kafka

::kafka::kafka create kafka_master

kafka_master create_producer kafka_producer
kafka_producer add_brokers 127.0.0.1


kafka_producer new_topic producer test

producer produce_one $partition $payload $key
```
